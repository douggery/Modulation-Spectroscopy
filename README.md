# Modulation-Spectroscopy
Interactive method of playing with multi tone frequency modulation spectroscopy with sliders

Frequency modulation spectroscopy is best understood intuitively using
graphical methods. However, when multiple tones are involved, the mixed products
can quickly exceed many pages of algebra. This code keeps track of things
and lets the user visualize the output directly.
